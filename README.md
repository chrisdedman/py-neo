Key features of the app include:

- Fetching NEO data for a specified date range.
- Visualizing NEO data in an easy-to-read format.
- Displaying information about NEOs, including::
  - Retrieving Object IDs and Names
  - Determining Hazardous Status
  - Displaying Close Approach Dates
  - Tracking Current and Past Orbiting Bodies
  - Providing Maximum and Minimum Diameters (in meters and feet)
  - Showing Velocity (in km/h and miles/h)
  - Classifying Orbit Types with Descriptions
  - Displaying First and Last Observation Dates

These features enable users to access, understand, and analyze essential information about Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) conveniently within the app.
